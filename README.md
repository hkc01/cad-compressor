## Part Comparisons and NX Commands
Highlighting pivotal parts and various commands utilized in their creation or constraints in sub-assemblies. New features like Sheet Metal Model, Spline, and Sweep Along Guide were learned.

## Drafting and Tolerances
Drafting is crucial for the piston, with assigned tolerances ensuring its free movement while maintaining a leak-proof fit and precise cylindrical shape.


## Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
A FEA was conducted to simulate stress on the piston, indicating the piston's safety under specified pressure conditions.


## Conclusion
The project necessitated creative solutions, proficiency in various NX commands, improved teamwork, and enhanced time management skills.
